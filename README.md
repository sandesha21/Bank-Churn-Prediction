# Bank Churn Prediction

## Overview  
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a retail bank using machine learning. By analyzing customer demographics, financial behavior, and engagement patterns, the model helps the bank identify customers at high risk of leaving and implement targeted retention strategies.

## Objective  
The main objective was to build and optimize predictive models that classify customers as likely to churn or stay. Early identification of churn-prone customers enables the bank to proactively engage them with personalized offers and improve overall customer loyalty.

## Dataset  
- **Source:** Provided as part of the project coursework  
- **Size:** ~10,000+ customer records  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Demographics (age, gender, geography)  
  - Account details (balance, products, credit score)  
  - Engagement metrics (tenure, activity patterns)  
- **Target:** Churn Status (`1` = Churned, `0` = Retained)

## Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaned and prepared data by encoding categorical variables, handling imbalances, and scaling features.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Explored churn patterns and feature correlations using visual and statistical methods.  
3. **Model Development** – Built and compared multiple neural network architectures with techniques like dropout, SMOTE, and optimizer tuning.  
4. **Evaluation & Insights** – Selected the best-performing model and extracted business insights from feature importance analysis.

## Results & Key Insights  
- Identified key churn drivers, including account tenure, balance, and number of products.  
- Helped design targeted retention strategies for high-risk customer segments.  
- Enabled data-driven decision-making for customer relationship management.

## Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
